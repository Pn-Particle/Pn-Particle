Preamble
New in town. Looking to learn. Got more question than answers at the moment. Will expand on that later on. 
Have been using Linux since early 1990 (RedHat). Debian, Mandrake (Mandriva), OpenSuse and now Ubuntu user.

First  computer own RadioShack “TRS 80” (Trash 80) and of course the Commodore 64. Follow by the Texas Instrument 99/4A and later on the with the Amiga. 
Showing my age I know! Still not an expert in any one particular field. Thought myself Basic, some C and C++ language while using Windows 
(Win 7, Vista and 10; what I call the MicroCrap Family.). Have dabble in Cobol and FORTRAN. 

Currently working with the Arduino components. Also trying to program the GM328 AY-AT Transistor Tester by blurpy (currently where I am having some issues).
Repairing Solar componenets & other power supplies and putting together Water Cool Computers. As you  can see I am all over the place. 
Don't know where I could be of any help. Fluent in English and Spanish (fluent meaning I don't need to translate in my mind.)
